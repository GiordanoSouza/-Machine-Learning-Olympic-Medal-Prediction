# -Machine-Learning-Olympic-Medal-Prediction

Olympic Medals Prediction Project

Welcome to our first machine learning project on GitHub! Our goal? To predict how many medals a country will win in the Olympics using old and new data.

Here's what we'll do:

Ask a question. What do we want to find out?
Look at the data. We use data from past Olympic games.
Get the data ready. We might need to change the data a bit to help us with our predictions.
Clean up the data. We make sure our data is good to go for machine learning.
Choose how to check our work. We decide how to tell if our predictions are good.
Split the data. We separate our data so we can test our model.
Train a model. We use machine learning to make our predictions.

much luv =)
